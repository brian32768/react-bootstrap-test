# react-router

*2024-08-21 this used to be about react-first-router but that project seems not to be
the path forward so I am just doing react-router now and apparently react-redux.
I am looking at https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial
changing it for Parcel

## Redux

In this demo, I want to be able to fill in a form and save its state in Redux so that when I go
to a different tab and then come back the content is preserved, unlike the react-simply
and react-context samples.

## Random notes

I needed to test the async loading

It looks like it's built using a sample API based on Star Wars running on Pipedream.
See https://pipedream.com/apps/swapi This lets me test the front end components without needing to set up a separate back end.

## Run it

   npm install
   npm start
