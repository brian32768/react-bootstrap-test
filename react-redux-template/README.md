# react-redux-first

I took the basic code from redux-first-router examples and then changed it for Parcel

2023-05-27 for my tiny apps all the fuss around Redux and React-First Router is boring
so I am leaving this demo for now.

Read about [React-First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router) in this [article on Medium]
(https://medium.com/codecademy-engineering/react-router-to-redux-first-router-2fea05c4c2b7)

I needed to test the async loading

It looks like it's built using a sample API based on Star Wars running on Pipedream.
See https://pipedream.com/apps/swapi This lets me test the front end components without needing to set up a separate back end.

## Run it

   npm install
   npm start
