# react-bootstrap-test/react-simply

Demo different 2 forms, one controlled and one uncontrolled.

## No state saving

I am not using Redux in this example to save state, 
so go to the Controlled Form tab and enter something.

Go to another tab.

Go back to Controlled Form.

Note that it's empty.

I will address this in react-redux-template
