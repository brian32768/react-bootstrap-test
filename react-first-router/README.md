# react-redux-template


I took the basic code from some redux-first-router examples and then changed it for Parcel

Read about [React-First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router) in this [article on Medium]

## Redux

In this demo, I want to be able to fill in a form and save its state in Redux so that when I go
to a different tab and then come back the content is preserved.

That means I need a form. :-)

## Redux ORM

This is the next holy grail; do SQL searches and show results.
I decided not to do that here because I would need a backend. It's in the records app.

## Random notes

I needed to test the async loading

It looks like it's built using a sample API based on Star Wars running on Pipedream.
See https://pipedream.com/apps/swapi This lets me test the front end components without needing to set up a separate back end.

## Run it

   npm install
   npm start
