# react-bootstrap-test/react-graphql

I am thinking that my application is simple so it does not need Redux or complex routing.
Pretty much it's a single form, maybe with an advanced form... so 2 forms...

On the data side, I have to access SQL Server and ugly tables.

Initially I tried making SQL relatively transparent and used REST calls.

This example will use GraphQL and hopefully encapsulate the ugly SQL tables
in the server side, passing only elegant data back to the client.

I have little experience with ORMs. I know they are an approach to this
problem too, but I think would also be overkill here.

So... summing up,

* client side: React and Bootstrap and JavaScript (no TypeScript, no Redux)
* server side: Node and JavaScript and GraphQL

**TypeScript** I tried to get a handle on TypeScript and finally decided last night that I actually need
to get my app working within the next 3 weeks, not 3 years. Ugh. Typed languages slow me down
but I make just as many misteaks. C was okay and maybe C++, but C# and Java? PASS. #life2short
