# react-bootstrap-test/react-graphql

I am thinking that my application is simple so it does not need Redux or complex routing.
Pretty much it's a single form, maybe with an advanced form... so 2 forms...

On the data side, I have to access SQL Server and ugly tables.

Initially I tried making SQL relatively transparent and used REST calls.

This example will use GraphQL and hopefully encapsulate the ugly SQL tables
in the server side, passing only elegant data back to the client.

On the client side I will need a GraphQL client but I am avoiding Redux so I will try Apollo. I tried Relay and fell flat on my face. 

I have little experience with ORMs. I know they are an approach to this
problem too, but I think would also be overkill here.

So... summing up,

* client side: React and Apollo and Bootstrap and JavaScript (no TypeScript, no Redux)
* server side: Node and JavaScript and GraphQL

**TypeScript** I tried to get a handle on TypeScript and finally decided last night that I actually need
to get my app working within the next 3 weeks, not 3 years. Ugh. Typed languages slow me down
but I make just as many misteaks. C was okay and maybe C++, but C# and Java? PASS. #life2short

## GraphQL, on the server side

The client sends queries in JSON, and the server does the database work and then sends back a JSON object in the same shape.
For example, this query

    {
        instrument(id: 123456) {
            id,
            firstname,
            lastname,
            recording_date
        }
    }

might return

    {
        "instrument": {
            "id": 123456,
            "firstname" : "James",
            "lastname" : "Dean",
            "recording_date": "01-01-1957"
        }
    }

The shape of the data is determined by the client instead of the server, that's cool, that's what I want.
The server still has to map the actual database column names but I will see how to do that soon.
## Apollo

I hope I am not heading down another dead end path here. I'll give it until lunchtime to see what it's about.
