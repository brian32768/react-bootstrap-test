I think I prefer this one: [Modern Full Stack Development](https://acm.percipio.com/books/6bd6da5d-c9d1-4855-8e42-ca1b70735eac)
It goes into Transcript and it covers using Docker too. The mailbag demo shows a full stack application.

I don't care about GraphQL, so I lost interest in this one. [Pro MERN Stack](https://acm.percipio.com/books/bae08639-c985-47d7-9ad8-58a15dcb1402#epubcfi(/6/254!/4/2%5Bepubmain%5D/2%5Bch0012_s1_8%5D/16/1:0))
Ignore the Webpack parts, use Parcel instead!
